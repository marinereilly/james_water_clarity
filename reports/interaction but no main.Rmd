Create two populations that start at the same place, but have diferent responses to `time`.

```{r}
popA <- c(rnorm(200, 0),
          rnorm(200, 5),
          rnorm(200, 10))

popB <- c(rnorm(200, 0),
          rnorm(200, 10),
          rnorm(200, 20))

fake_data <- data.frame(
  population = rep(c('A', 'B'), each = 600),
  response = c(popA, popB),
  time = rep(
    rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 200),
    times = 2
  )
)
```

## Full model

`population` term is not significant.

```{r}
m_full <- lm(response ~ population*time,
             data = fake_data)
summary(m_full)
```

## Model without the main effect of `population`

In this instance, similar estimates (possibly not the case with more-complicated models?).

```{r}
m_nomain <- lm(response ~ time + population:time,
               data = fake_data)
summary(m_nomain)
```



```{r}
anova(m_full, m_nomain, test = 'LRT')
```
